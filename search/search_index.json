You will run your artifacts through a validation process and package them for use in deployment. Finally, you will create a new plan for your existing offer from Lab 1 and publish your offer. Exercise 1 - ARM TTK # This exercise introduces Azure Resource Manager Template Toolkit (ARM TTK), a tool that runs in PowerShell and validates the artifacts in your deployment package. The ARM TTK tool runs tests that ensure valid mainTemplate.json and createUiDefinition files. You will clone the ARM TTK repository and bring the code to your local machine where it can be executed using PowerShell. If you are not on Windows, you may download PowerShell for your platform. Linux macOS Clone the ARM TTK repository from GitHub. Set up ARM TTK to run on your machine by executing the following commands in a PowerShell terminal. cd \"<PATH TO ARM TTK REPO>\\arm-ttk\\arm-ttk\" Import-Module .\\arm-ttk.psd1 From the same directory you may execute the ARM TTK tool as shown below. Note the path is looking at the end folder, which contains the solution to this lab. $AMAPackage = \"<PATH TO AMA-WORKSHOP>\\ama-workshop\\lab-2-deployment-package\\assets\\end\\\" Test-AzTemplate -TemplatePath $AMAPackage See that test pass.

Validating end\\mainTemplate.json deploymentTemplate [+] adminUsername Should Not Be A Literal (90 ms) [+] apiVersions Should Be Recent In Reference Functions (171 ms) ... You will use the ARM TTK tool to check the status of your own package files several times during this lab. Because of this, do not close the terminal window between steps. Set up ARM TTK to point at the begin directory for validation as shown below. $AMAPackage = \"<PATH TO AMA-WORKSHOP>\\ama-workshop\\lab-2-deployment-package\\assets\\begin\\\" Run the tests as shown below. They should all pass although the mainTemplate.json file in the begin directory is basically a skeleton you will build on. Test-AzTemplate -TemplatePath $AMAPackage Exercise 2 - mainTemplate.json # Here you will build out a ARM template that deploys a virtual machine along with some other Azure services. The basic outline of a mainTemplate.json ARM template looks like this. { \"$schema\": \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#\", \"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\", \"parameters\": {}, \"variables\": {}, \"resources\": [], \"outputs\": {} } There are several parameters the ARM template expects. You will fill them in and take note of the different types of parameters. Open the mainTemplate.json file in a text editor like VS Code. Add the following JSON inside the parameters section of the ARM template. \"adminUsername\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"metadata\": { \"description\": \"Username for the Virtual Machine.\" } }, \"adminPassword\": { \"type\": \"securestring\", \"metadata\": { \"description\": \"Password for the Virtual Machine.\" } }, \"storageAccountName\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"storageAccountType\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"windowsOSVersion\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"defaultValue\": \"2019-datacenter-gensecond\", \"allowedValues\": [ \"2019-datacenter-gensecond\", \"2016-datacenter-gensecond\" ], \"metadata\": { \"description\": \"The Windows version for the VM. This will pick a fully patched image of this given Windows version.\" } }, \"vmSize\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"defaultValue\": \"Standard_D2s_V3\", \"metadata\": { \"description\": \"Size of the virtual machine.\" } }, \"vmName\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"defaultValue\": \"amaSimpleVM\", \"metadata\": { \"description\": \"Name of the virtual machine.\" } }, \"location\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"defaultValue\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\", \"metadata\": { \"description\": \"Location for all resources.\" } } Take a moment to review the type attribute of each parameter. See that you can pass in multiple data types. Run ARM TTK. The following test fails. Parameters Must Be Referenced Make the variables section look like the following JSON. \"variables\": { \"itemPrefix\": \"[concat('ama', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]\", \"addressPrefix\": \"10.0.0.0/16\", \"domainNameLabel\": \"[concat(variables('itemPrefix'), '-dnl')]\", \"networkSecurityGroupName\": \"[concat(variables('itemPrefix'), '-nsg')]\", \"nicName\": \"[concat(variables('itemPrefix'), '-nic')]\", \"publicIPAddressName\": \"[concat(variables('itemPrefix'), '-ip')]\", \"storageAccountName\": \"[concat(parameters('storageAccountName'), uniqueString('storage'))]\", \"subnetName\": \"Subnet\", \"subnetPrefix\": \"10.0.0.0/24\", \"subnetRef\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets', variables('virtualNetworkName'), variables('subnetName'))]\", \"virtualNetworkName\": \"[concat(variables('itemPrefix'), '-vnet')]\" } Run ARM TTK. Now there are parameters and variables that are not being referenced. This means they are not being referenced in the resources section which defines the actual resources to be created by the ARM template. \ud83d\uddd2\ufe0fNote the itemPrefix parameter is not reported as an unreferenced parameter since it being used by several other variables. Add the following resource definitions to the resources[] section. { \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts\", \"apiVersion\": \"2018-02-01\", \"name\": \"[variables('storageAccountName')]\", \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\", \"sku\": { \"name\": \"[parameters('storageAccountType')]\" }, \"kind\": \"Storage\", \"properties\": {} }, { \"type\": \"Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses\", \"apiVersion\": \"2020-06-01\", \"name\": \"[variables('publicIPAddressName')]\", \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\", \"properties\": { \"publicIPAllocationMethod\": \"Dynamic\", \"dnsSettings\": { \"domainNameLabel\": \"[variables('domainNameLabel')]\" } } }, { \"comments\": \"Default Network Security Group for template\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups\", \"apiVersion\": \"2021-08-01\", \"name\": \"[variables('networkSecurityGroupName')]\", \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\", \"properties\": { \"securityRules\": [ { \"name\": \"default-allow-3389\", \"properties\": { \"priority\": 1000, \"access\": \"Allow\", \"direction\": \"Inbound\", \"destinationPortRange\": \"3389\", \"protocol\": \"Tcp\", \"sourcePortRange\": \"*\", \"sourceAddressPrefix\": \"*\", \"destinationAddressPrefix\": \"*\" } } ] } }, { \"type\": \"Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks\", \"apiVersion\": \"2020-06-01\", \"name\": \"[variables('virtualNetworkName')]\", \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\", \"dependsOn\": [ \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups', variables('networkSecurityGroupName'))]\" ], \"properties\": { \"addressSpace\": { \"addressPrefixes\": [ \"[variables('addressPrefix')]\" ] }, \"subnets\": [ { \"name\": \"[variables('subnetName')]\", \"properties\": { \"addressPrefix\": \"[variables('subnetPrefix')]\", \"networkSecurityGroup\": { \"id\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups', variables('networkSecurityGroupName'))]\" } } } ] } }, { \"type\": \"Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces\", \"apiVersion\": \"2020-06-01\", \"name\": \"[variables('nicName')]\", \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\", \"dependsOn\": [ \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/', variables('publicIPAddressName'))]\", \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/', variables('virtualNetworkName'))]\" ], \"properties\": { \"ipConfigurations\": [ { \"name\": \"ipconfig1\", \"properties\": { \"privateIPAllocationMethod\": \"Dynamic\", \"publicIPAddress\": { \"id\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses',variables('publicIPAddressName'))]\" }, \"subnet\": { \"id\": \"[variables('subnetRef')]\" } } } ] } }, { \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines\", \"apiVersion\": \"2020-06-01\", \"name\": \"[parameters('vmName')]\", \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\", \"identity\": { \"type\": \"systemAssigned\" }, \"dependsOn\": [ \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('storageAccountName'))]\", \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/', variables('nicName'))]\" ], \"properties\": { \"hardwareProfile\": { \"vmSize\": \"[parameters('vmSize')]\" }, \"osProfile\": { \"computerName\": \"[parameters('vmName')]\", \"adminUsername\": \"[parameters('adminUsername')]\", \"adminPassword\": \"[parameters('adminPassword')]\" }, \"storageProfile\": { \"imageReference\": { \"publisher\": \"MicrosoftWindowsServer\", \"offer\": \"WindowsServer\", \"sku\": \"[parameters('windowsOSVersion')]\", \"version\": \"latest\" }, \"osDisk\": { \"createOption\": \"FromImage\" }, \"dataDisks\": [ { \"diskSizeGB\": 1023, \"lun\": 0, \"createOption\": \"Empty\" } ] }, \"networkProfile\": { \"networkInterfaces\": [ { \"id\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces',variables('nicName'))]\" } ] }, \"diagnosticsProfile\": { \"bootDiagnostics\": { \"enabled\": true, \"storageUri\": \"[reference(resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('storageAccountName'))).primaryEndpoints.blob]\" } } } } Take moment to examine the different resources that will be created by this ARM template. Run ARM TTK. One test should fail. terminal apiVersions Should Be Recent The resource type of Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts has an old API version. Fix this problem as recommended by ARM TTK. Ensure ARM TTK passes with no errors. Your ARM template is complete. Exercise 4 - createUiDefinition.json # This exercise will take you through creating the file that defines the user experience for installing your solution via the mainTemplate.json created in Exercise 3. The role of the createUiDefinition.json file is to do the following. 1. Provide parameters to the mainTemplate.json ARM template. 2. Provide an installation user experience for the customer. The main components of a createUiDefinition.json file looks like this. { \"$schema\": \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/0.1.2-preview/CreateUIDefinition.MultiVm.json#\", \"handler\": \"Microsoft.Azure.CreateUIDef\", \"version\": \"0.1.2-preview\", \"parameters\": { \"basics\": [], \"steps\": [], \"outputs\": {} } } Create the file # Create the file createUiDefinition.json in your begin folder. Paste the above JSON into the new file. Run ARM TTK. You get several errors on the createUiDefinition.json file because the sections of the file are yet filled in yet. The Create UI Definition Sandbox # The Create UI Definition Sandbox is a tool for testing createUiDefinition.json files. Open the Create UI Definition Sandbox in the Azure portal. Delete the JSON in the JSON area of the sandbox blade. Paste the JSON from your createUiDefinition.json file into the sandbox JSON area. Click the Preview button at the bottom of the page. The sandbox renders the content from your createUiDefinition.json . The Basics section displays the default fields that are rendered when the basics section of the JSON is empty. The steps[] section # Go back to your createUiDefinition.json file. Add the following JSON into the steps[] array. This will add a new tab, or blade, to the experience the customer will see during installation. { \"name\": \"prefixBlade\", \"bladeTitle\": \"Item Prefix\", \"label\": \"Item Prefix\", \"elements\": [] } Paste the JSON from your file in the Create UI Definition Sandbox . You should see a new Item Prefix tab. Click the Item Prefix tab. > The blade is blank and has no controls on it. On the left side of the sandbox, note there is a list of controls. Copy the TextBox control into your clipboard. In your createUiDefinition file, paste the control into the elements array of the JSON blade. Check your JSON in the sandbox. Remove the blade definition from the steps[] array in the createUiDefinition.json file so that the array is empty. Fill in the steps[] array with the JSON below. { \"name\": \"storageConfigBlade\", \"label\": \"Storage account settings\", \"bladeTitle\": \"Storage account settings\", \"elements\": [ { \"name\": \"storageAccount\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage.MultiStorageAccountCombo\", \"label\": { \"prefix\": \"Storage account prefix\", \"type\": \"Storage account type\" }, \"toolTip\": { \"prefix\": \"The prefix of the storage account\", \"type\": \"The type of storage account\" }, \"defaultValue\": { \"type\": \"Standard_LRS\" }, \"constraints\": { \"allowedTypes\": [ \"Premium_LRS\", \"Standard_LRS\", \"Standard_GRS\" ] }, \"count\": 2 } ] }, { \"name\": \"vmBlade\", \"bladeTitle\": \"Virtual Machine\", \"label\": \"Virtual Machine\", \"elements\": [ { \"name\": \"vmName\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Common.TextBox\", \"label\": \"Machine name\", \"placeholder\": \"Virtual machine name\", \"defaultValue\": \"\", \"toolTip\": \"Use only allowed characters\", \"constraints\": { \"required\": true, \"regex\": \"^[a-z0-9A-Z]{5,15}$\", \"validationMessage\": \"Only alphanumeric characters are allowed, and the value must be 5-15 characters long.\" }, \"visible\": true }, { \"name\": \"adminUsername\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute.UserNameTextBox\", \"label\": \"Admin Username\", \"toolTip\": \"The username of the admin user for the VM\", \"constraints\": { \"required\": true, \"regex\": \"^[a-z0-9A-Z]{1,30}$\", \"validationMessage\": \"Only alphanumeric characters are allowed, and the value must be 1-30 characters long.\" }, \"osPlatform\": \"Windows\", \"visible\": true }, { \"name\": \"adminPassword\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Common.PasswordBox\", \"label\": { \"password\": \"Password\", \"confirmPassword\": \"Confirm password\" }, \"toolTip\": \"Password for the VM\", \"constraints\": { \"required\": true, \"regex\": \"^[a-zA-Z0-9]{12}$\", \"validationMessage\": \"Password must be at least 12 characters long, contain only numbers and letters\" }, \"options\": { \"hideConfirmation\": false }, \"visible\": true }, { \"name\": \"operatingSystem\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Common.DropDown\", \"label\": \"Windows operating system\", \"defaultValue\": \"2022-Datacenter\", \"toolTip\": \"Choose an operating system to deploy\", \"constraints\": { \"allowedValues\": [ { \"label\": \"2019 Datacenter 2nd Gen\", \"value\": \"2019-datacenter-gensecond\" }, { \"label\": \"2016 Datacenter 2nd Gen\", \"value\": \"2016-datacenter-gensecond\" } ], \"required\": true }, \"visible\": true }, { \"name\": \"vmSize\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute.SizeSelector\", \"label\": \"Virtual machine size\", \"toolTip\": \"Choose the size of virtual machine to create\", \"recommendedSizes\": [ \"Standard_D2s_v3\" ], \"options\": { \"hideDiskTypeFilter\": false }, \"osPlatform\": \"Windows\", \"visible\": true } ] }, { \"name\": \"tags\", \"label\": \"Tags\", \"elements\": [ { \"name\": \"tagsByResource\", \"type\": \"Microsoft.Common.TagsByResource\", \"toolTip\": \"Tags for resources being created\", \"resources\": [ \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts\", \"Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines\" ] } ] } Check your JSON in the sandbox to ensure it is valid. The outputs section # Now that you have all of the steps defined in your createUiDefinition.json file, you can focus on the outputs section, which passes the control values to the ARM template during installation. Fill in the outputs section of your createUiDefinition.json file with the JSON below. \"adminPassword\": \"[steps('vmBlade').adminPassword]\", \"adminUsername\": \"[steps('vmBlade').adminUsername]\", \"windowsOSVersion\": \"[steps('vmBlade').operatingSystem]\", \"vmSize\": \"[steps('vmBlade').vmSize]\", \"location\": \"[location()]\", \"storageAccountName\": \"[steps('storageConfigBlade').storageAccount.prefix]\", \"storageAccountType\": \"[steps('storageConfigBlade').storageAccount.type]\", \"vmName\": \"[steps('vmBlade').vmName]\" Note how the output keys match the input parameter names in the mainTemplate.json ARM template. Also note how the values reference blade values, except for the location() function, which is a required output value. Check your files with ARM TTK . Check your JSON in the sandbox. Your createUiDefinition.json is now complete. Exercise 5 - Deploying your deployment package files # In this exercise, you will create a second plan in the offer you created in Lab 1 . In the begin folder, create a ZIP file with two deployment package files at the root. Name the file gold-plan-deployment-package.zip . Go back to Partner Center . Navigate to the offer you created in Lab 1. Click Plan overview in the left hand menu. Create a new plan named Gold in your offer. Use the same techniques you used in Lab 1 to create your Silver plan. When you get to the Pricing and availability section of your new offer, remember to check the boxes and fill in the units on the metered billing dimensions. Exercise 6 - Publish your offer # Now that you have two plans in your offer, it's time to publish your offer. In Partner Center click the Review and publish button at the top right of the page, which takes you to the Review publish changes page. Once all indicators are green, click the Publish button at the bottom of the page. You will be taken to the Offer overview page where you can monitor the status of your offer as it progresses to the Publisher signoff stage. (This requires refreshing the page periodically). The publishing process can take some time to complete, but should be done in time for the next lab. \u26a0\ufe0f DO NOT go past the Publisher signoff stage by clicking the Go live button once it appears. Conclusion # Great job, you've finished lab 2! In this lab you accomplished the following. Used ARM TTK to validate your deployment files. Fleshed out an ARM template in mainTemplate.json . Created the user experience for installing the solution via the ARM template using createUiDefinition,json . Created a deployment package from the artifacts in this lab.

Open the Azure portal and browse to your ACR. In the left menu, select Services > Repositories . You should see an a view like the following image. Helm Chart # In this section will explore the Helm Chart directory AzureTodo . About Helm Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. In other words, it is used to help you manage Kubernetes applications. Helm is the Kubernetes equivalent of yum or apt . Helm deploys charts, which you can think of as a packaged application. Open container-labs\\container-package\\AzureTodo\\values.yaml in your text editor. Update lines 10 & 14 with your ACR server name. For example myacr.azureacr.io . Locate the value of the todojs:v1 digest and copy it. Image Digest The image digest is the hash of the image index or image manifest JSON document. Inspect the images you pushed to the ACR earlier. Open each repository in the ACR and see that individual versions of an image will have their own Digest value. Get Digest from local image Run docker inspect <myacr>.azureacr.io\\todojs:v1 you can locate the disget value under RepoDigests Paste the todojs:v1 digest value onto line 8. Update line 12 with mongo:latest image digest.

Overview # In this lab, you will build on what you accomplished in previous labs. You will create a SaaS offer webhook and integrate it with your Partner Center SaaS offer configuration, enabling your webhook to respond to subscription change events. The webhook in your Visual Studio solution is an Azure Function. There is no need to change the code in the webhook function at this time. Looking through the webhook code you'll find that it simply prints the REST payload to the log. You will monitor this log to see the payload when the webhook is called. Exercise: Create a Publish Profile # In Visual Studio, right click the SaaSFunctions project and select Publish . For the target, select Azure and click Next . Select Azure Function App (Windows) and click Next . Select the right subscription in the dropdown. To publish, you will need to create a new Function App. Above and to the right of the Function Apps tree at the bottom of the dialog, click the + button to add a new Function App. In the Name field, enter SaaSWorkshopFunction followed by a number to make it a unique name. Select the right subscription. Select the `saas-workshop`` Resource Group. Stick with Plan Type: Consumption. Function Apps require the use of a Data Storage account. To the right of the Azure Storage field is a New... link. Click it. On the Azure storage dialog, click the OK button. Back on the Function App (windows) dialog, click the Create button. The App Service deployment will run for a little while. On the Publish dialog, click the Next button. On Select the Publish option and click the Finish button. You have create an App Service, App Service Plan, storage account, and a publish profile. Now you will use the purlish profile to publish the function application itself. Exercise: Publish the Function App # At the top right of the publish screen, click the Publish button. It will take a moment to publish the function application. You can watch progress in Visual Studio's Output window. Exercise: Getting the webhook URI # You need the webhook URI to add to your Technical Configuration in Partner Center. The Function Application contains only one function and you need the URI of that one function. Open the Azure portal. Find and click on the Azure function in the Azure portal. It is inside your saas-workshop resource group. In the left-hand menu find the Functions link and click it. You see a single function named Webhook . Click that function. Near the top of the screen, click Get Function URL and you are presented with a dialog. Copy the full path to this function into your copy/paste buffer. Exercise: Publishing the webhook in Partner Center # Now you will re-publish your offer, this time with a valid webhook URL. In Partner Center, on the Technical configuration tab, find the Connection webhook field. Replace the previous value for the Connection webhook with the URL of the function application Click Save Draft . Review and publish your offer. It should pass validation (all sections are green) so you can publish. Click the Publish button. The offer must be in the Partner Center's preview stage for the final exercise of this lab to work. At no point should you click the Go live button. Publication Time # This is where you must wait for your offer to be re-published. Of course, there is a waiting period for the offer to be re-published. The good news is that it is usually much faster after the first time. Note: If you are in a live workshop event, please raise your hand in Microsoft Teams to indicate you are done with the lab to this point. You will be coming back to finish the rest of the lab later, perhaps on your own after the workshop. Exercise: Preparing to monitor the function's log # To see the function's output, we will monitor its log on Azure to see the output it will print to the log. Application Insights must be enabled on the function to support this. Open Azure portal and find the Function App. Click it. Scroll down in the left-hand menu until you find the Monitoring section. In the Monitoring section, find the Log stream link and click it. You are presented with a message to configure Application Insights. Click the Configure button. Under Create new resource enter SaaSWorkshopFunction-ai . Choose an appropriate location. Click the OK button at the bottom of the screen. Application insights will install. In the upper breadcrumb navigation, click the function SaaSWorkshopFunction which takes you back to the Log monitoring screen. This should open what looks like a terminal window and you will see \"Connected!\" at the top of the window. You are now watching the function application's log. There will be occasional keep-alive calls to the function that can be ignored. You can click the Clear button at the top of the screen to clear the text at ay time. Exercise: Invoking the Webhook # In a previous lab, you purchased a SaaS offer. That offer is in the Subscribed state, so the customer can unsubscribe from the offer. That's what you will do to invoke the webhook and see it's output. Unsubscribe from the offer # Open a new tab to the Azure portal. In the command bar at the top type SaaS and click the SaaS service that is appears. Find the offer you purchased earlier and click it. At the top of the page, click and confirm Cancel subscription . Fill in the required information to unsubscribe from the offer. Click the Cancel subscription button. You will get a message in the upper right of your window stating that cancellation of the subscription is in progress. See the Unsubscribe event # Go back to your function's Log tab. You will likely have time to hit the Clear button to clear the screen. It can take a few minutes for the Unsubscribe event to invoke the webhook. Don't forget that your offer must be in the Publisher signoff stage for the webhook to be fully published so it will be invoked. Just wait for the Unsubscribe event to show up in the Log window and print the payload to the screen.

You should finish this lab before moving on to the next labs in this course. Prerequisites before starting this lab # Partner Center Account with enrollment in the commercial marketplace program Access to the Azure Portal on the same tenant as is on Partner Center (Same tenancy is required to ensure you can publish images out of Azure Compute Galleries, more on this in the later modules). Create a new Virtual Machine Offer # In this section you will be creating a brand new VM Offer from scratch. This will be used for publishing the offer once the rest of your labs are completed. The following steps will create an offer on your Partner Center Portal. On the Homepage of Partner Center, look for Marketplace Offers and click that tile. If you have disabled Workspaces, then it will be visible as Commercial Marketplace. Click the + New Offer button and select Azure Virtual Machine from the dropdown. You will now have to enter a unique Offer ID and an Offer Alias. For the purpose of uniformity for this lab, we will set a unique string to identify resources, like so, Offer ID: vmworkshop-YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING Offer Alias: VM Workshop YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING Replace the variable YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING with a name unique to your organization Once the offer is created, navigate to the Offer Setup page by clicking on that tab on the left. Offer Setup # Offer Setup page will direct you with ways to change your offer alias as well as enable Test Drive. For the purpose of this lab, we will leave everything as is and only configure the Customer leads section. Customer leads # Here, you will attach your offer to an Azure Data Storage table which will act as a connected Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) for your offer. Create the Azure Storage account # This is the first time you're using the Azure portal for this class. It is recommended that you install all the resources you'll create in this class into the same Resource Group, just to keep things tidy within your Azure subscription. Open a new tab for the Azure portal and log in. Create a Resource Group named vmworkshop-YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING . Please note that this is the same unique string you added while creating the offer. In the vmworkshop-YOUR_UNIQUE_STRING Resource Group, create a standard Azure Storage account. This will be your CRM database, so name it vmworkshopsayouruniquestring . Note all characters are lower case for naming a storage account. Once the storage account is created, browse to the storage account's overview page. In the left-hand menu, find the Security + networking section. In that section, find and click on the Access keys link. At the top of the page, click the Show keys link, and you see the connection strings for the database. Copy a connection string to your copy/paste buffer. Configure Customer Leads in Partner Center # Go back to the Partner Center tab in your browser. Select the Connect link. From the Lead destination dropdown, select Azure Table . Enter your Contact email and paste in your Storage account connection string . Click the Validate link to ensure your connection string is valid. Click Connect . Click Save draft at the bottom of the page. \u26a0\ufe0f For each page, you must click the Save draft at the bottom of the page to move on. Properties # Navigate to the Properties page by selecting the Properties tab on the left. Categories # You must select at least one category for your offer. Virtual machine offers always appear under the Compute category in Azure Marketplace. For this lab we will be selecting the below configurations. Click the + Categories link. In the left dropdown, select Compute . In the right dropdown, select Application Infrastructure . Legal # We will be using the Microsoft Standard Contract for this lab. You may choose differently when you are publishing to the prod environment. Scroll down to the Legal section.

In the the Offer listing section, for Search results summary enter VM Workshop summary . For Short Description and Description , here is some text you may choose to copy and paste into the text box. Quis aute iure reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint obcaecat cupiditat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum. In the Privacy policy link , enter the public link to the privacy policy for your company if you know it. If not, follow this link to Microsoft's privacy policy and use that URL. >Please note that using Microsoft's privacy policy is only for the purpose of this lab and should not be used for your production offer. In the Customer Support links section, enter Azure support website information (Optional) In the Partner Support Contact section, enter your contact information. In the Engineering Contact section, enter your engineering contact information. In the Cloud Solution Provider Program Contact section, enter the appropriate contact information (Optional) For the Marketplace media section you'll upload 2 images, both of which are available here . For the 216X216 logo image, upload the PNG provided. This PNG is named \" Contoso-Logo-216x216.png .\" For the 1280X720 screenshot image, upload the PNG provided. This PNG is named \" Screenshots-1280x720.png .\" Add a screenshot image caption. Click the Save draft button and correct any errors that be shown before moving on. Preview audience # In the Preview audience section, enter your Azure subscription Id. Enter a Description (Optional). Click Save draft . Technical configuration # Skip this section for this lab. You'll come back to it later. Plan overview # Skip this section for this lab. You'll come back to it later. Resell through CSPs # Finally navigate to the Resell through CSPs tab. Select \"No partners in the CSP program.\" Click the Save draft button at the bottom of the screen. Review and Publish # In this short exercise, you will check your work by performing the first action of the publication process. You will submit your offer for review to see if it is ready to be published. Open your offer's overview page. In the upper right corner of the page, click the link for Review and publish . Looking to the right side of the page, notice that some sections have a green circle and at least one is gray. The gray sections are not yet complete, preventing you from taking the next step of publishing your offer. The Plan overview section of the offer will not pass review. This is okay for now as we need to fill out the Plan overview tab and you can't do that until we have a VM image. All other sections should be green. Go back to all sections that appear with a gray circle and complete those sections with the guidance provided above. Ensure all sections pass except Plan overview , which will be addressed in the next lab. Congratulations!
